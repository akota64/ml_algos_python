# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
A repository for coding machine learning algorithms in Python.

To-Do:
- Implement a Regression class for LogisticRegression and LinearRegression to inherit from. 
-- w, b, alpha, epsilon? attributes
-- train, predict methods
- Fix LogisticRegression to instantiate w, b based on X values (to avoid log-0 errors), or center and scale X values within the algorithm.
